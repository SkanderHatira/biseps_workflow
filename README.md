# Snakemake workflow: dmr-pipe

[![Snakemake](https://img.shields.io/badge/snakemake-â‰¥5.23.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://snakemake.bitbucket.io)

This is a snakemake pipeline for bisulfite sequencing data, it implements:
1. 	Adapter trimming and quality check
2.	Quality reports and statistics (fastqc+multiqc)
3.	Methylation extraction with bismark (bowtie2/hisat2 as aligners)
4.	DMR identification with DMRCaller (in all contexts) : in progress

## Usage

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this (original) repository and, if available, its DOI (see above).

### Step 1: Obtain a copy of this workflow

[Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) the newly created repository to your local system, into the place where you want to perform the data analysis.

	git clone git@forgemia.inra.fr:skander.hatira/dmr-pipe.git

### Step 2: Configure workflow

Configure the workflow according to your needs via editing the files in the `config/` folder. Adjust `config.yaml` to configure the workflow execution, and `samples.tsv`, `units.tsv` to specify your sample setup.

### Step 3: Install Snakemake

Install Snakemake using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html):

    conda create -c bioconda -c conda-forge -n snakemake snakemake

For installation details, see the [instructions in the Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).

### Step 4: Execute workflow

Activate the conda environment:

    conda activate snakemake

Test your configuration by performing a dry-run via

    snakemake --use-conda -n

Execute the workflow locally via

    snakemake --use-conda --cores $N

using `$N` cores or run it in a cluster environment via

    snakemake --use-conda --cluster qsub --jobs 100

or

    snakemake --use-conda --drmaa --jobs 100

If you not only want to fix the software stack but also the underlying OS, use

    snakemake --use-conda --use-singularity

in combination with any of the modes above.
See the [Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executable.html) for further details.

### Step 5: Investigate results

After successful execution, you can create a self-contained interactive HTML report with all results via:

    snakemake --report report.html

This report can, e.g., be forwarded to your collaborators.
An example (using some trivial test data) can be seen [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/snakemake-workflows/rna-seq-kallisto-sleuth/master/.test/report.html).
